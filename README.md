# Intro

The purpose of this project is ONLY to serve as a study case of how neural networks work without using any libraries already available, but rather implementing the network from scratch. Please do not use this project in any production environment as it is probably broken in multiple places and it's not supposed to have good performance.

I'm also not well versed in Rust, so there might be issues with the way I've used the language. It was also a fun project for me to learn more about the language.


# Running

Place the `minst_test.csv` and `mnist_train.csv` files inside the `src` folder and then just run `cargo run`. You can download the mnist set in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv).


# Results

After 1000 iterations, I've got an accuracy of roughly 90% in the mnist dataset but the main goals of this project were achieved - learn about NN and Rust.
